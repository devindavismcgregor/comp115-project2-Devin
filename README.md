I started out with the alien invaders game and learned about pygame and pygame coding from there, as well as googling things I didnt know. Then I wanted to do something different, and thought of a basic idea of bouncing a ball up and down like ping pong or tennis. If the ball doesn't hit the paddle then the game is over, and if the ball hits it, it adds points a point. 

from there I went through lots of trial and error because I'm not that good at this stuff. I used chatgpt to help me fix my code and give advice here and there. 

It turned out okay, but for some reason the points counter starts off at 3 when you start the game, I think everything else works ok.
